Description:
    Creates the required tables for the has_fields gem

Example:

    Basic Usage:

        rails generate has_fields_generator Post organization
        
      This will create three tables in the database:
        fields
        attributes
        select_options
        
      If you want to add a prefix to the table names, you can add a prefix on the end of the generate call:
        
        rails generate has_fields_generator Post organization has_fields
        
      Which should result in these tables:
      
        has_fields_fields
        has_fields_attributes
        has_fields_select_options
        
      If you want to name the tables something different again, edit the migration, and pass the option for the table name in the has_fields call.
