Description:
    Creates the required tables for the has_custom_fields gem

Example:

    Basic Usage:

        rails generate has_custom_fields_generator Post

      This will create two tables in the database for the Post model,
      post_fields and post_attributes with no scoping
        
    Using Scopes:
